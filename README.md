ObjectMover

‚¶Å	Create a simple project in Unity using C# with the following requirements:
In the scene there are 100 objects that are spawned at random positions that can collide with a main game object.
The main game object moves at a constant speed, starting at (0, 0, 0), towards 3 points (P1, P2, P3) that can be changed by a designer.
At arrival at each point, the game object should begin movement toward the next point.
On arrival at the final point or if a collision is detected, the main game object should be removed from the scene, play a sound effect and show a particle effect.
Note that the game uses the physics system provided by Unity and the collisions are reported by Unity.
